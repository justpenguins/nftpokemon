# nftpokemon

Hi and welcome to our github repo for our HackCamp 2021 submission. This project is like pokemon for NFTs, where their stats are generated off their minting hash. We used the covalent api with python/django for our tech stack. 

If you're interested in seeing the code we wrote the bulk of it will be in the website\nftpokemon directory in the assorted py files such as nfts.py, battle.py, algorithm.py and views.py.
